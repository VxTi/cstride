# Standard Library

Stride's standard library is located in `packages/standard-library/` and includes math, memory, and I/O modules.

This is still in development.

## Modules

- **Math**: Basic mathematical functions.
- **Memory**: Memory management utilities.
- **I/O**: Input and output operations.

## Using the Standard Library

Imports are currently being implemented. The planned format is:

```stride
import std::{ Math };
```
